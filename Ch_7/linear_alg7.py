# Question 5
'''
Let B be the basis of set of prime numbers P 3 consisting of the Hermite polynomialsâ€‹ 1, 2t, negative 2 plus 4 t squared comma and negative 12 t plus 8 t cubed ; and let Bold p left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 10 minus 4 t squared plus 8 t cubed . Find the coordinate vector of p relative to B.

# Question 11
'''
The statement is true. The columns of ModifyingBelow Upper P With Upper C left arrow Upper B are linearly independent because they are the coordinate vectors of the linearly independent set B.

The statement is false. Matrix P satisfies left bracket Bold x right bracket Subscript Upper C Baseline equals Upper P left bracket Bold x right bracket Subscript Upper B for all x in V.
