a. A linear transformation is a special type of function.
True. A linear transformation is a function from set of real numbers R Superscript n to set of real numbers R Superscript m that assigns to each vector x in set of real numbers R Superscript n a vector ​T(x​) in set of real numbers R Superscript m.

b. If A is a 3 times 5 matrix and T is a transformation defined by ​T(x​)equalsAx​, then the domain of T is set of real numbers R cubed.

False. The domain is actually set of real numbers R Superscript 5​, because in the product Ax​, if A is an m times n matrix then x must be a vector in set of real numbers R Superscript n.

c. If A is an m times n ​matrix, then the range of the transformation x maps to  Ax is set of real numbers R Superscript m.
False. The range of the transformation is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of​ A, because each image of the transformation is of the form Ax.

d. Every linear transformation is a matrix transformation.

False. A matrix transformation is a special linear transformation of the form x maps to Ax where A is a matrix.

e. e. A transformation T is linear if and only if Tleft parenthesis c 1 Bold v 1 plus c 2 Bold v 2 right parenthesisequalsc 1 Upper T left parenthesis Bold v 1 right parenthesis plus c 2 Upper T left parenthesis Bold v 2 right parenthesis for all Bold v 1 and Bold v 2 in the domain of T and for all scalars c 1 and c 2.

True. This equation correctly summarizes the properties necessary for a transformation to be linear.

a. If A is a 4 times 3 ​matrix, then the transformation x maps to Ax maps set of real numbers R cubed onto set of real numbers R Superscript 4. Choose the correct answer below.
False. The columns of A do not span set of real numbers R Superscript 4.

b. Every linear transformation from set of real numbers R Superscript n to set of real numbers R Superscript m is a matrix transformation. Choose the correct answer below.
True. There exists a unique matrix A such that Upper T left parenthesis Bold x right parenthesis equals Upper A Bold x for all x in set of real numbers R Superscript n.

c. The columns of the standard matrix for a linear transformation from set of real numbers R Superscript n to set of real numbers R Superscript m are the images of the columns of the n times n identity matrix under T. Choose the correct answer below.
True. The standard matrix is the m times n matrix whose jth column is the vector Upper T left parenthesis Bold e Subscript j right parenthesis​, where Bold e Subscript j is the jth column of the identity matrix in set of real numbers R Superscript n.

d. A mapping​ T: set of real numbers R Superscript nmaps toset of real numbers R Superscript m is​ one-to-one if each vector in set of real numbers R Superscript n maps onto a unique vector in set of real numbers R Superscript m. Choose the correct answer below.
False. A mapping T is said to be​ one-to-one if each b in set of real numbers R Superscript m is the image of at most one x in set of real numbers R Superscript n.

e. The standard matrix of a horizontal shear transformation from set of real numbers R squared to set of real numbers R squared has the form left bracket Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column a 2nd Column 0 2nd Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column d EndMatrix right bracket .

# Question 12
'''
Determine if the specified linear transformation is ​(a​) ​one-to-one and ​(b​) onto. Justify each answer.

a.
T is not​ one-to-one because the columns of the standard matrix A are linearly dependent.

b. 
T is onto because the columns of the standard matrix A span set of real numbers R squared.
